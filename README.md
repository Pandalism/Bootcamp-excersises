# Exercises with Data Science Libraries

This project contains a set of exercises that help building familiarity with the main Data Science libraries in Python.

It include exercises `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

Each exercise is a function that you will need to implement. They are defined accross four files `intro_numpy`, `more_numpy`, `intro_pandas`, `intro_matplotlib`.

Follow the instructions in the docstring of the functions and submit your code on KATE.

Good luck!
