# Exploratory Data Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction in Python

This project contains a set of exercises that help building familiarity with the main Data Science libraries in Python and how to apply them on basic exploratory data analysis tasks. You will also find an exercise on dimensionality reduction using PCA.

The main libraries at play here are `numpy`, `pandas` and `scikit-learn`

Each exercise is a function that you will need to implement.

Follow the instructions in the docstring of the functions and submit your code on KATE.

Good luck!
