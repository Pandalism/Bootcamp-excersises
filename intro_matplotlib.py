    line.

    Plot the following lines on the same plot

      y=cos(x) coloured in red with dashed lines
      y=x^2 coloured in blue with linewidth 3
      y=exp(-x^2) coloured in black

    Add a legend, title for the x-axis and a title to the curve, the x-axis
    should range from -4 to 4 (with 50 points) and the y axis should range
    from 0 to 2. The figure should have a size of 8x6 inches.

    NOTE: Make sure you create the figure at the beginning as doing it at the 
    end will reset any plotting you have done.
